This is my public letter to the office of Strategic Planning regarding Buffalo's usage of Federal CDBG Funds:

As a resident of the City of Buffalo, I'm very frustrated with the lack of transparency with CDBG funds. Also, I'm very frustrated with the lack of public input and participation. The notification of CDBG budget hearings and public input sessions are lackluster at best. The extremely low rate of puiblic participation in CDBG allocation does not seem to be a concern for the Office of Strategic planning. In order to correct this, the office of strategic planning needs to implement a 'Participatory Budgeting' solution. A perfect example is the current change being advocated for by the Clean Air Coalition www.pbbuffalo.org. We need this change and the current CDBG budgetary process is unacceptable.
